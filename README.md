## About Quotes App

It's an app that was created through the angular cli. It consists of two components that is __quotes component__ and the __quote form component__ the two components communicate with each other when adding a new quote into the page. The app also has a date pipe that calculates the number of days when the `quote` was created.

## Project set up instructions

* I ran __ng new Quote__ to start up the project.
* then created two components _quote component_ and _quote form component_ using __ng generate component quote__ and __ng generate component quote-form__.
* then created the custom `date` **Pipe** called _date-count_ using the command __ng generate pipe date-count__.
